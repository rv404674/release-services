"desc": "servo: Merge #19884 - Fix mutation test in CI by passing env vars correctly (from aneeshusa:fix-mutation-test); r=jdm\n\nOriginally, buildbot would try to directly execute `RUSTFLAGS=` as a binary\nsince it was the first token in the command string, which won't work.\n\nFix this by using the `env` command to set the environment variables,\nas there is currently no support for setting per-step environment variables\nin the `buildbot_steps.yml` file.\n\n\u003c!-- Thank you for contributing to Servo! Please replace each `[ ]` by `[X]` when the step is complete, and replace `__` with appropriate data: --\u003e\n- [ ] `./mach build -d` does not report any errors\n- [x] `./mach test-tidy` does not report any errors\n- [x] These changes should fix #19821 (github issue number if applicable).\n\n\u003c!-- Either: --\u003e\n- [ ] There are tests for these changes OR\n- [x] These changes do not require tests because they change the CI configuration\n\n\u003c!-- Also, please make sure that \"Allow edits from maintainers\" checkbox is checked, so that we can help you if you get stuck somewhere along the way.--\u003e\n\n\u003c!-- Pull requests that do not address these steps are welcome, but they will require additional verification as part of the review process. --\u003e\n\nSource-Repo: https://github.com/servo/servo\nSource-Revision: 025e5d773313e16ffe73ae63efc068b79b82d531",
